                    <p>
                        Spir is a design response to a brief asking students to create a product range with a specific audience. The purpose of this project is to take into account the environmental impact of the production process and prompt students to approach the creation of 3 products from an ethically conscious viewpoint.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The name "Spir" is the Latin root word for "breathe". It is where we get words like respire, inspire, spirit & aspire. All of which are key words that align with Spir's purpose to provide individuals with the tools for mental wellbeing.

                    <p>
                        The paper used in this project was made from recycled scrap paper, sourced directly from the private practice where the final product will be sold. The scrap paper was broken down into pulp and meticulously handcrafted using traditional papermaking techniques.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        This sustainable approach not only reduces waste but creates a unique texture and character that machine-made paper cannot replicate.

                    <p>
                        The brandmark was designed to be a wordmark that can be used as a stamp on the paper itself. It was appropriate to have a mark that feels clean, healthy & professional as that is the environment that it will be seen in.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The typography is carefully crafted to convey trust and serenity, essential qualities for a mental health-focused brand.

                    <p>
                        My idea for this piece was to combine the Yin Yang symbol and an infinity loop. The Yin (dark) is represented by the black and red koi fish whilst the yang (light) is represented by the white and blue koi fish.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The infinity loop was introduced to represent the infinite battle between light and dark in all of us (infinite for our lifetime that is).

                    <h2>Artwork 02: Tree of Life Growing from a Human Brain</h2>
                    <p>
                        My intention for this piece was to symbolise the idea of journaling, to grow your mind. The tree of life represents the position we have all found ourselves in; reality, life, our human experience.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The human brain represents where this experience happens for us; consciousness, thoughts, memory and speech. The design is off-centered to account for the book binding, completed with both the title of the product as well as Spir's logo.

                    <p>
                        For the affirmation card I needed it to be simple, not only for its purpose but also because of the time restrictions. So I played on the idea from my second design, specifically the moon and the colour scheme.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I wanted the focus to be drawn to the words of affirmation written on the back, creating a meditative and calming experience for the user.
